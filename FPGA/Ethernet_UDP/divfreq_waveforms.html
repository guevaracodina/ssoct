<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file divfreq.v </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of altpll megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design divfreq.v. The design divfreq.v has Stratix II AUTO pll configured in NORMAL mode The primary clock input to the PLL is INCLK0, with clock period 6666 ps. Output port LOCKED will go high when the PLL locks to the input clock. </P>

<P><FONT size=3>When input port ARESET is asserted, it will cause the LOCKED port and all CLK outputs to drop to zero. The PLL will relock to the input clock when this port is deasserted. </P>
